# 🤖 Automatic Greeting System

This guide explains the automatic greeting system that proactively welcomes users when they connect to the HR Voice Assistant.

## 🎯 Overview

The automatic greeting system creates a welcoming and proactive user experience by greeting users immediately when they connect, before they even say anything. This eliminates the awkward silence and makes the interaction feel more natural and engaging.

### Key Benefits:
- **🤖 Proactive Engagement**: Agent greets user first, creating immediate connection
- **👤 Personalized Greetings**: Uses user's name for a personal touch
- **🎲 Variety**: Multiple greeting options to avoid repetition
- **⚡ Instant Feedback**: User knows the system is working immediately
- **💬 Natural Flow**: Creates a conversational atmosphere from the start

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. Connection Flow

```
User Connects → Agent Session Starts → Automatic Greeting Sent → User Sees Welcome Message
```

### 2. Greeting Process

1. **Connection Established**: User connects to LiveKit room
2. **Session Initialization**: Agent session starts successfully
3. **User Configuration**: System retrieves user's name and preferences
4. **Greeting Selection**: Random greeting chosen from available options
5. **Message Sent**: Greeting sent to frontend and spoken aloud
6. **User Experience**: User sees and hears the welcome message

### 3. Greeting Options

The system includes 5 different greeting variations:

| Greeting | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **Welcome** | "Hello John! I'm your HR assistant. How can I help you today?" |
| **Friendly** | "Hi John! Welcome to your HR assistant. What can I do for you?" |
| **Professional** | "Good day John! I'm here to help with any HR questions you might have." |
| **Ready** | "Hello John! Your HR assistant is ready to assist you. How may I help?" |
| **Comprehensive** | "Hi there John! I can help you with company policies, benefits, leave requests, and more. What would you like to know?" |

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Agent-Side Implementation

#### 1. Automatic Greeting Function

```python
async def send_automatic_greeting(session: AgentSession, assistant: 'Assistant'):
    """Send automatic greeting when connection is established"""
    try:
        # Wait for connection to establish
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        
        # Get user configuration
        user_config = get_user_config()
        user_name = user_config.get("user_name", "there")
        
        # Create personalized greeting messages
        greeting_options = [
            f"Hello {user_name}! I'm your HR assistant. How can I help you today?",
            f"Hi {user_name}! Welcome to your HR assistant. What can I do for you?",
            f"Good day {user_name}! I'm here to help with any HR questions you might have.",
            f"Hello {user_name}! Your HR assistant is ready to assist you. How may I help?",
            f"Hi there {user_name}! I can help you with company policies, benefits, leave requests, and more. What would you like to know?"
        ]
        
        # Select random greeting
        import random
        greeting = random.choice(greeting_options)
        
        # Send to frontend
        await send_text_to_frontend(
            session=session,
            message_type="automatic_greeting",
            content=greeting,
            metadata={
                "source": "agent",
                "greeting_type": "connection_established",
                "user_name": user_name,
                "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
            }
        )
        
        # Speak the greeting
        await assistant.say(greeting)
        
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error sending automatic greeting: {e}")
```

#### 2. Function Tool for LLM

```python
@function_tool
async def send_connection_greeting(self):
    """Send a personalized greeting when the user first connects"""
    logger.info("🤖 Sending connection greeting...")
    
    # Get user configuration
    user_config = get_user_config()
    user_name = user_config.get("user_name", "there")
    
    # Select and send greeting
    greeting = random.choice(greeting_options)
    
    # Send to frontend and speak
    await send_text_to_frontend(session, "automatic_greeting", greeting)
    await assistant.say(greeting)
    
    return greeting
```

#### 3. Integration in Entrypoint

```python
async def entrypoint(ctx: JobContext):
    # ... session setup ...
    
    # Start the session
    assistant = Assistant()
    assistant._session = session
    await session.start(agent=assistant, room=ctx.room)
    
    # Send automatic greeting after successful connection
    await send_automatic_greeting(session, assistant)
    
    # ... rest of setup ...
```

### Frontend Implementation

#### 1. Message Handler

```dart
void _handleAutomaticGreeting(String message) {
  _logger.i('🤖 Automatic greeting: $message');
  
  // Add to agent messages with special formatting
  final timestamp = DateTime.now().toLocal().toString().substring(11, 19);
  final timestampedMessage = '[$timestamp] [Welcome] $message';
  
  _agentMessages.add(timestampedMessage);
  _latestAgentText = message;
  
  // Send to live transcript stream
  _liveTranscriptController.add({
    'speaker': 'agent',
    'transcript': message,
    'timestamp': DateTime.now().toIso8601String(),
    'is_partial': false,
    'is_automatic_greeting': true,
  });
  
  notifyListeners();
}
```

#### 2. Message Type Detection

```dart
} else if (messageType == 'automatic_greeting' && content != null) {
  print('🤖 AUTOMATIC GREETING DETECTED - Processing...');
  _handleAutomaticGreeting(content);
  print('🤖 Automatic greeting stored successfully');
  _logger.i('🤖 Automatic greeting captured');
}
```

## 📱 User Experience

### Before (No Automatic Greeting)
```
User connects → [Silence] → User: "Hello?" → Agent: "Hello! How can I help?"
```
**Result**: Awkward silence, user uncertainty, feels like system is broken

### After (With Automatic Greeting)
```
User connects → Agent: "Hello John! I'm your HR assistant. How can I help you today?"
```
**Result**: Immediate engagement, professional experience, user feels welcomed

### Frontend Display
```
[14:32:15] [Welcome] Hello John! I'm your HR assistant. How can I help you today?
```

## 🎨 Customization Options

### 1. Adding New Greeting Variations

```python
greeting_options = [
    f"Hello {user_name}! I'm your HR assistant. How can I help you today?",
    f"Hi {user_name}! Welcome to your HR assistant. What can I do for you?",
    f"Good day {user_name}! I'm here to help with any HR questions you might have.",
    f"Hello {user_name}! Your HR assistant is ready to assist you. How may I help?",
    f"Hi there {user_name}! I can help you with company policies, benefits, leave requests, and more. What would you like to know?",
    # Add new greetings here
    f"Welcome {user_name}! I'm your dedicated HR assistant. What can I help you with today?",
    f"Good to see you {user_name}! I'm here to assist with all your HR needs. How may I help?",

### 2. Time-Based Greetings

```python
def get_time_based_greeting(user_name: str) -> str:
    """Get greeting based on time of day"""
    from datetime import datetime
    hour = datetime.now().hour
    
    if 5 <= hour < 12:
        return f"Good morning {user_name}! I'm your HR assistant. How can I help you today?"
    elif 12 <= hour < 17:
        return f"Good afternoon {user_name}! I'm your HR assistant. What can I do for you?"
    elif 17 <= hour < 21:
        return f"Good evening {user_name}! I'm your HR assistant. How may I help?"
    else:
        return f"Hello {user_name}! I'm your HR assistant. How can I help you today?"
```

### 3. Company-Specific Greetings

```python
def get_company_greeting(user_name: str, company_name: str) -> str:
    """Get company-specific greeting"""
    return f"Hello {user_name}! Welcome to {company_name}'s HR assistant. How can I help you today?"
```

### 4. User Role-Based Greetings

```python
def get_role_based_greeting(user_name: str, user_role: str) -> str:
    """Get greeting based on user role"""
    if user_role == "manager":
        return f"Hello {user_name}! I'm your HR assistant for management queries. How can I help you today?"
    elif user_role == "employee":
        return f"Hi {user_name}! I'm your HR assistant. What can I help you with today?"
    else:
        return f"Hello {user_name}! I'm your HR assistant. How can I help you today?"
```
