# LiveKit Agents Starter - Python

A complete starter project for building voice AI apps with [LiveKit Agents for Python](https://github.com/livekit/agents).

The starter project includes:

- A simple voice AI assistant based on the [Voice AI quickstart](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/start/voice-ai/)
- Voice AI pipeline based on [OpenAI](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/integrations/llm/openai/), [Cartesia](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/integrations/tts/cartesia/), and [Deepgram](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/integrations/llm/deepgram/)
  - Easily integrate your preferred [LLM](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/integrations/llm/), [STT](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/integrations/stt/), and [TTS](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/integrations/tts/) instead, or swap to a realtime model like the [OpenAI Realtime API](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/integrations/realtime/openai)
- Eval suite based on the LiveKit Agents [testing & evaluation framework](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/testing/)
- [LiveKit Turn Detector](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/turns/turn-detector/) for contextually-aware speaker detection, with multilingual support
- [LiveKit Cloud enhanced noise cancellation](https://docs.livekit.io/home/cloud/noise-cancellation/)
- Integrated [metrics and logging](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/metrics/)

This starter app is compatible with any [custom web/mobile frontend](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/start/frontend/) or [SIP-based telephony](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/start/telephony/).

## Dev Setup

Clone the repository and install dependencies to a virtual environment:

```console
cd agent-starter-python
uv sync
```

Set up the environment by copying `.env.example` to `.env.local` and filling in the required values:

- `LIVEKIT_URL`: Use [LiveKit Cloud](https://cloud.livekit.io/) or [run your own](https://docs.livekit.io/home/self-hosting/)
- `LIVEKIT_API_KEY`
- `LIVEKIT_API_SECRET`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: [Get a key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) or use your [preferred LLM provider](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/integrations/llm/)
- `DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`: [Get a key](https://console.deepgram.com/) or use your [preferred STT provider](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/integrations/stt/)
- `CARTESIA_API_KEY`: [Get a key](https://play.cartesia.ai/keys) or use your [preferred TTS provider](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/integrations/tts/)

You can load the LiveKit environment automatically using the [LiveKit CLI](https://docs.livekit.io/home/cli/cli-setup):

```bash
lk app env -w .env.local
```

## Run the agent

Before your first run, you must download certain models such as [Silero VAD](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/turns/vad/) and the [LiveKit turn detector](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/turns/turn-detector/):

```console
uv run python src/agent.py download-files
```

Next, run this command to speak to your agent directly in your terminal:

```console
uv run python src/agent.py console
```

To run the agent for use with a frontend or telephony, use the `dev` command:

```console
uv run python src/agent.py dev
```

In production, use the `start` command:

```console
uv run python src/agent.py start
```

## Frontend & Telephony

Get started quickly with our pre-built frontend starter apps, or add telephony support:

| Platform | Link | Description |

| **iOS/macOS** | [`livekit-examples/agent-starter-swift`](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-swift) | Native iOS, macOS, and visionOS voice AI assistant |
| **Flutter** | [`livekit-examples/agent-starter-flutter`](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-flutter) | Cross-platform voice AI assistant app |
| **React Native** | [`livekit-examples/voice-assistant-react-native`](https://github.com/livekit-examples/voice-assistant-react-native) | Native mobile app with React Native & Expo |
| **Android** | [`livekit-examples/agent-starter-android`](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-android) | Native Android app with Kotlin & Jetpack Compose |
| **Web Embed** | [`livekit-examples/agent-starter-embed`](https://github.com/livekit-examples/agent-starter-embed) | Voice AI widget for any website |
| **Telephony** | [ðŸ“š Documentation](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/start/telephony/) | Add inbound or outbound calling to your agent |

For advanced customization, see the [complete frontend guide](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/start/frontend/).

## Tests and evals

This project includes a complete suite of evals, based on the LiveKit Agents [testing & evaluation framework](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/build/testing/). To run them, use `pytest`.

```console
uv run pytest
```

## Using this template repo for your own project

Once you've started your own project based on this repo, you should:

1. **Check in your `uv.lock`**: This file is currently untracked for the template, but you should commit it to your repository for reproducible builds and proper configuration management. (The same applies to `livekit.toml`, if you run your agents in LiveKit Cloud)

2. **Remove the git tracking test**: Delete the "Check files not tracked in git" step from `.github/workflows/tests.yml` since you'll now want this file to be tracked. These are just there for development purposes in the template repo itself.

3. **Add your own repository secrets**: You must [add secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/using-secrets-in-github-actions) for `OPENAI_API_KEY` or your other LLM provider so that the tests can run in CI.

## Deploying to production

This project is production-ready and includes a working `Dockerfile`. To deploy it to LiveKit Cloud or another environment, see the [deploying to production](https://docs.livekit.io/agents/ops/deployment/) guide.
